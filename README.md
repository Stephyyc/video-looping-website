# Video-Looping-Website
TL;DR: This is an in-progress music practicing tool for musicians made with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery, that allows users to learn music off of Youtube videos. They choose their own video, then practice sections of the video by replaying on repeat with different playback speeds.
Made with @mwz210.

# Steps: 
- Upload a video of your choice by pasting a Youtube link to the video (TBD)
- Add sections of the video you'd like to practice 
- Practice those sections on repeat, from .25x playback speed to 2.0x playback speed. 
  - You can use the countdown feature between loops
- Check those sections off when you're done! 
- Revel in your new skills (´･ω･`)

# Installation:
This project is still in progress and uses a sample video on my local computer. If you want to try it out, for now, you could insert your video of choice into the HTML -- but don't worry, dynamical video loading functionality will come later! 

Note: This project is not fully functional across all platforms or browsers. Currently, the webpage works best on Edge or Chrome browser. I'm looking into why this is the case, and hope to make it functional across all platforms.
