# Video-Looping-Website
TL;DR: This is an in-progress music practicing tool for musicians made with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery, that allows users to learn music off of Youtube videos. They choose their own video, then practice sections of the video by replaying on repeat with different playback speeds.

Made with @mwz210.

# Steps: 
- Upload a video of your choice by pasting a Youtube link to the video (TBD)
- Add sections of the video you'd like to practice 
- Practice those sections on repeat, from .25x playback speed to 2.0x playback speed. 
  - You can use the countdown feature between loops
- Check those sections off when you're done! 
- Revel in your new skills (´･ω･`)

# Installation:

Project is still in progress and have only gotten all the functionality of the video controls done. However, there isn't an easy way to upload and practice with your own video. If you are really interested in using it then be willing to download all the files in MKV Practice Tool Folder and then switch your own video with the sample video that is provided in the folder. Just make sure you name the video the same name as the sample video since that part is hard coded for now.

Note: This project is not fully functional across all platforms or browsers. Currently, the webpage works best on Edge or Chrome browser. I'm looking into why this is the case, and hope to make it functional across all platforms.
